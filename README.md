 ## Introduction
 - Summary: 
  entails of research objectives, background information, study justification, study limitation and problem scope of the proposed system

## Objectives
### Specific 
1. come up with a clients/customers module where they can sign in/create an account if they don’t have one and also log in to the website with ease to see available services |
2. come up with an admin’s module to see and reserve the bookings made by clients/customers |
3.  come up with a database to store data for the system and integrate it with the necessary modules |
4. come up with an employee module for them to see which client they are assigned to.

- Background information: The proposed system was inspired by the less spa websites locally. Well we find that in this less websites, they are owned by large spas in the country e.g. the lavish ones in developed places, in hotels (Kempinski) and etc. With this proposed system it will be kind of a free lance one. The remote spa’s prolly haven’t seen this/ rather can’t afford them. 
-Study justification: 
Remote spas have been left out. How can they develop when they are not digitally known? Why should we keep visiting the lavish ones and neglecting the remote ones? Charity begins at home. The remote spas also offer services similar to the lavish spas. But most of tend to despise the remote ones because they are viewed as less attractive unless the employees have a friendly connection with their previous customers. So the proposed system will be of great help since it will be simple and easy affordable after a month free trial

- Problem scope: Technical scope: with my pro-efficient skills I anticipate to use HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and MYSQL for database. The text editors: Visual studio code, sublime text.

## Technicality

### Users
 1. Spa owners/administrators/managers
 2. Spa employees
 3. Clients/customers

## System requirement specification

### Functional Requirements

#### Users module
- view dashboard 
- registration(sign up if no account)
- login 
- ID/PASSPORT NO verification
- password
- book for interested services
- payment(whichever mode available)
- give feedback 
- log out/ sign out

#### Employees module
- view dashboard
- login
- employee no. verification
- password
- see reserved bookings assigned to
- report to the work station 
- log out 

#### Admin/spa owners/spa managers module
- view dashboard
- login as an administrator
- password
- password verification
- see all the signing up and adding clients credentials to the database
- authorize all the logins
- see available bookings made by clients
- assign each employee to the customers
1. **Requirement testing**;- I intend to use unit testing to test if my modules work as implemented. In addition I will use integration testing to ensure all my features can victoriously pass data to one another and to the database. I will also perform system testing to ensure that the system works as designed in low-level design


### Non-Functional Requirements
These requirements won’t affect the usability of the system but will make the system more efficient and long term. They may or may not be implemented but the system will work normally:-
- Platform compatibility
- Security (details are secured)
- Fast internet connection
- Encryption of Data
1. **Requirement testing**:- Also I intend to do cross-platform compatibility testing to see whether the system will run on several Operating Systems.

## Language, Framework & other technicalities
- I intend to use the following programming and styling languages: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) for front end development, Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) for styling web pages, JavaScript for interactive purposes, MySQL for database. Also for the development work, l will use the following text editors: Visual Studio code, Sublime text, Xammp
